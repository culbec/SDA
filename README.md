# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my work for the Data Structures and Algorithms course. It focuses on different Data Structures, their iterators and 
algorithmic approaches for their implementation, all of which I received as homework.

## Contents

### [Dictionary]()

This project contains my approach on implementing a 'dictionary' using a 'Dynamic Vector'.

### [List]()

This project contains my approach on implementing a 'list' using a 'Singly Linked List'.

### [Sorted List]()

This project contains my approach on implementing a 'sorted list' using a 'Singly Linked List'.

### [Rare Matrix]()

This project contains my approach on implementing a 'rare matrix' using a 'Hash Table'.

### [Binary Tree]()

This project contains my approach on implementing a 'binary tree' using a 'Dynamic Vector'.
